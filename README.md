# Sudoku Solver

This repository contains Python programs to solve Sudoku puzzles using various algorithms.

## Features
- **Sudoku Solver**: Uses the backtracking algorithm to solve any valid Sudoku puzzle. The program tries to fill each cell by checking all possible numbers and backtracks when a conflict arises.
  
- **Brute Force Solver**: Solves the puzzle through brute force, trying every possible combination to find the correct solution.

- **Sudoku Brute Force (Alternative)**: A variation of the brute force method, potentially using different optimizations or order of cell filling.

## Files
- `Sudoku.py`: A Sudoku solver that implements the backtracking algorithm.
  
- `Bruteforce.py`: Brute force algorithm that attempts all possibilities to solve the puzzle.

- `Sudoku_Bruteforce.py`: Another brute force variant for solving Sudoku puzzles.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cobra-Sanjay/Sudoku.git
   ```
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
